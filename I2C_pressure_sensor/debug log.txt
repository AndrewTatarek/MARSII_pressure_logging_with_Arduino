let ps = arduino pressure sensor

ps 0,2,3 all plugged in
ps 0 is running blink
ps 0,3 are wrapped up
only ps 2 works
restarted ps 3
only ps 2 works
unplugged ps 2
marsDebugger pauses when run
marsDebugger altered to fail without hardware
unplugged ps3
debugging serialwin32
	fixed issue that program fails when stepped through by a debugger
	found that win32.GetOverlappedResult was pausing forever, fixed issue by redownloading blink to ps 0, cause still unknown
put I2C code on ps 0 
currently ps 0 is the only board plugged in
ps 0 works correctly
ps 2 plugged in
ps 0,2 both work correctly
unplugged ps 0,2
plugged  ps 3
ps 3 restarts as expected but is not visible as a COM port
ps 3 unplugged
ps 3 unwrapped
ps 3 plugged in
ps 3 still not visible as com port
ps 3 plugged in a new usb point that has not been used yet
ps 3 still not visible as com port
I remove the pressure sensor from arduino board number 3
arduino 3 still does not show up as com port
I found a windows message that says that there was a usb malfunction, this may have been around a while
restart windows
arduino 3 still does not show up as com port
I conclude that the usb capability on the ps 3 board is broken and not easily fixed
I replaced the arduino board
